# DoublyLinkedLists
Doubly Linked Lists using CodeBlocks, Doxygen

This is a learning exercise incorporating doubly-linked lists, various sorting algorithms, 
randomized test cases, and doxygen documentation. This is going to be a working exercise
to simply get used to using repositories, preparing documentation, and refreshing on
some of the finer programming topics. We'll ramp up to genetic algorithms at a later time.
